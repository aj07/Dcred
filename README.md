# **Decentralized Credit modelling**

## **Problem:**

Today we are riding the wave of web3 ecosystem in every dimension but credit modelling is something which is still in centralized way, leaded by Transunion / Experian / Equifax / Fitch / Moodyâ€™s / S&P etc. There's always risk in using centralized credit risk management software.  These are things for fiat industry. But for crypto ecosystem there is no scoring mechanism.  
Why it is needed ?
There are CDP's Dapp where people to lending and borrowing and also there are few other lending dapp's where there is chance of getting default. As of now Dapp ecosystem is working on oracle concept for lending but it's not full proof mechanism . Like banks uses credit score for giving loan to individuals. Similarly, there's need to be credit score for fiat ecosystem for lending . This will make user's more credible and help them to take more and more loan. Also, there are various other incentives user's can have with this scoring methodology. 

## **Solution:**

To overcome all these, we come up with a solution on Ethereum based ecosystem where credit risk will be rated in decentralized way. We are working for crypto based ecosystem as of now, since crypto ecosystem is public whereas, fiat is still private. 
We are collecting various data points not only from user's but their wallets, person who they are interacting (in anonymized way) . The detailed process are as follow:

 - User will enter their wallet address. Login with their wallet.
 -  User will be asked few questions. Answers entered by users will depict the
   behavior of user around market, power to take decision etc. 
  
 - Data points will be collected from etherscan like volume and
   frequency of    transactions. 
       
 - User can ask their peers whom they interacted through wallet to rate
   them.

      

 - Rating will completely done on ZeroKnowledgeProof algorithm to hide
   the identity of peers.

 

 - Only    things sure will be that  peers have interacted with users.
   That will    be cross verified by transaction history.
 - If that wallet has been    used with some CDP portals then also it
   will be taken into accounts.

*We will take as many as data points and put into credit modelling algorithm and give the reputation of user's wallet address. **It will be completely upon users to revel their score to other's or not.***

## Unique insights about the industry gathered through primary or secondary research

**

Based out of our research we found various insights. All these insights are taken into consideration after through research of all CDP Dapps, lending Dapps and other decentralized financial instruments. Also, we have gone through all the research paper around finance and ZKP theory. 

 - There is no concrete credit score mechanism for crypto ecosystem.
 - There is a chance of getting default for lending ecosystem.
 - Price fluctuation is the major concerns for users.

 

 - Stable coin has solve the fluctuation but upto certain limit.
 - Oracle concept is still in test phase and it's not full-proof.
 - People are more tend to CDP to increase their profitability.
 - Wallet transaction is high during major news.
 - Whales plays very important role in price.
 - Peers have almost no chance to rate their peers whom they are
   interacting.
 - If there is good user's for particular set's of peers then their is
   no reward mechanism for it.

## Evidence of team-wide entrepreneurial behavior and spirit throughout the Relay

**
Ankit is leading this project. Along with him there are other 2 devs working on.

 Ankit is part of incubator Entrepreneur First. Also he is a Blockchain engineer and currently researching around fintech industry to put proper usecases
of privacy part of blockchain. Previously, he has built his own startup Blockvidhya and got grant from Ethereum Foundation to work on Solidity. He has also worked with Ocean Protocol as Blockchain developer and with Red Hat for Distributed System project GlusterFS. He has won multiple hackathon globally like 
EthIndia (Dharma track)
Dorahack
EthSingapore (ZkDai, Privacy for Maker).

Other 2 devs were part of Hack in same team where he participated.

## Proof that blockchain adds significant value to this solution over centralized alternatives

**

There are couple on benefits of using blockchain over existing system.

 - Credit modelling decision will be taken after cross verifying the
   transaction history of wallet which is itself a very big thing in
   respect to transparency and  decentralization.
 - It will be on Blockchain which can't be overwritten. This will help
   to see the correct history.
 - Once data is on the chain it's their forever.
 - ZKP will help to protect the identity of users while rating and
   Credit modelling decision will be taken after cross verifying the
   transaction history of wallet which is itself a very big thing in
   respect to transparency and decentralization.

Above all mentioned it has all the properties of public blockchain which I don't think its necessary to mention the benefit of it. We all the working on Ethereum ecosystem and we are well aware of benefits of it. :)
